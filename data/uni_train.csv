"Are the following two sentences entailment or not entailment? Answer me with ""entailment"" or ""not entailment"".","1. Cairo is now home to some 15 million people - a burgeoning population that produces approximately 10,000 tonnes of rubbish per day, putting an enormous strain on public services.

It is often the people in the poorest neighbourhoods that are worst affected. But in some areas they are fighting back. In Shubra, one of the northern districts of the city, the residents have taken to the streets armed with dustpans and brushes to clean up public areas which have been used as public dumps.

""If someone snaps and wants to do something stupid, there's no distance that's going to stop them,"" said Jake King, 56, an Amish lantern maker who knew several families whose children had been shot.
